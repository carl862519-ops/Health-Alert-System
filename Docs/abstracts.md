## Location
Mozambique, 2024

## Problem Statement
Limited access to continuous patient monitoring systems in home-care and resource-constrained healthcare settings, leading to delayed response to medical emergencies.

## Proposed Solution
An Arduino-based integrated monitoring system that tracks:
1. Heart rate via infrared photoplethysmography
2. Patient position and fall detection
3. Intravenous fluid level monitoring
4. Automated visual and auditory alerts

## Innovation
- Multi-parameter integration in single device
- Priority-based alert hierarchy
- Low-cost components (<$30)
- Easy deployment in various settings
- Open-source design for adaptation

## Expected Impact
- Reduced complication rates in home care
- Decreased workload for healthcare professionals
- Improved patient safety
- Accessible technology for developing regions
- STEM education through practical application
