# MEDICAL APPLICATION CONTEXT

## Clinical Use Cases

### 1. Post-Operative Home Care
- Continuous monitoring after hospital discharge
- Early detection of complications
- Reduced hospital readmissions

### 2. Elderly Care and Fall Prevention
- 24/7 position monitoring
- Immediate fall detection
- Peace of mind for caregivers

### 3. Hospital Ward Monitoring
- Multi-patient tracking
- Staff alert system
- Resource optimization

### 4. Chronic Condition Management
- Long-term vital sign tracking
- Medication reminder integration potential
- Telemedicine compatibility

## Monitored Parameters

### Heart Rate Monitoring
- **Technology**: Infrared reflectance photoplethysmography
- **Normal Range**: 50-120 beats per minute (adults)
- **Bradycardia**: <50 BPM (requires medical attention)
- **Tachycardia**: >120 BPM (requires investigation)
- **Accuracy**: ±5 BPM in controlled conditions

### Fall/Position Detection
- **Sensor**: Tilt switch (mercury or ball type)
- **Response Time**: <1 second
- **False Positive Prevention**: 2-second confirmation delay
- **Applications**: Bed exit alarms, fall prevention

### IV Fluid Monitoring
- **Principle**: Conductivity-based level detection
- **Alert Threshold**: 20% remaining volume
- **Critical Alert**: 5% remaining volume
- **Safety Feature**: Prevents air embolism risk

## Alert Protocol

### Level 1: SAFE (Green LED)
- **Conditions**: All parameters within normal range
- **Actions**: No audio alerts, green LED solid
- **Response**: Routine monitoring continues

### Level 2: ALERT (Yellow LED)
- **Conditions**: 
  - Abnormal heart rate (outside 50-120 BPM)
  - Low fluid level detected
- **Actions**: Intermittent buzzer (600Hz), yellow LED blinking
- **Response**: Check patient within 15 minutes

### Level 3: CRITICAL ALARM (Red LED)
- **Conditions**: Fall detected
- **Actions**: Continuous buzzer (1200Hz), red LED fast blinking
- **Response**: Immediate assistance required (<2 minutes)

## Mozambique Healthcare Context
- **Challenges**: Limited medical resources, rural access issues
- **Opportunity**: Low-cost monitoring solutions
- **Training**: Can be operated by community health workers
- **Scalability**: Modular design for different healthcare levels
